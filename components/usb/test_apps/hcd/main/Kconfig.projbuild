            USB-OTG peripheral features a DRVVBUS signal, which controls the VBUS voltage. The DRVVBUS signal can be
            either internally connected to a PHY (if a PHY supports it), in such a case the PHY would be controlling
            the VBUS voltage by itself. Or the DRVVBUS can be handled by an external logic (a transistor switch).
            Our PHY does not support the DRVVBUS signal, thus we must use an external logic to control the VBUS
            voltage. The DRVVBUS signal is controlled via HCD_PORT_CMD_POWER_OFF and HCD_PORT_CMD_POWER_ON

            GPIO number, that will be internally connected to the DRVVBUS signal.
            USB Host CI target runners feature an external power switch controlled by this GPIO, to control the VBUS
            voltage of USB devices during test.
