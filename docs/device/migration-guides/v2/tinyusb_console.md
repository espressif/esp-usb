# Migration guide to Espressif's TinyUSB addition: Console

## 1. Do I need to migrate?

Update brings the consistency for the Espressif's TinyUSB addition extensions public API.

## 2. Changes Required After Migration

To simplify the migration process, compatibility with the previous API has been retained. During the first build, you will see the following warning:

```bash
"This header file is deprecated since v2.0.0.  Use 'tinyusb_console.h' for the new development."
```

The old API is still supported, but it is recommended to update your code, as the old API may be removed in future releases.

## 3. List of Changes

### API Updates

The following function prototypes have been updated:

| Old Function Prototype                              | New Function Prototype                                 |

| `esp_err_t esp_tusb_deinit_console(int cdc_intf)`   | `esp_err_t tinyusb_console_deinit(int cdc_intf)`       |
