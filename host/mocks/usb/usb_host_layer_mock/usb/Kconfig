            Each USB device attached is allocated a dedicated buffer for its OUT/IN transfers to/from the device's
            control endpoint. The maximum size of that buffer is determined by this option. The limited size of the
            transfer buffer have the following implications:
            - The maximum length of control transfers is limited
            - Device's with configuration descriptors larger than this limit cannot be supported
