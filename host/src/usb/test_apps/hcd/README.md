# USB: Host test application

There are three sets of tests in this application:
1. Low-speed: Expects low-speed USB mouse with interrupt endpoint to be connected
2. Full-speed: Expects full-speed USB flash disk with 2 bulk endpoints to be connected
3. High-speed: Expects high-speed USB flash disk with 2 bulk endpoints to be connected

For running these tests locally, you will have to update device definitions (VID, PID, ...) in [dev_msc.c](../common/dev_msc.c), [dev_hid.c](../common/dev_hid.c) and  [dev_isoc.c](../common/dev_isoc.c).
